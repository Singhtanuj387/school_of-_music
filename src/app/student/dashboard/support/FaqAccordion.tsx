    q: "How do free trial lessons work?",
    a: "Every new student account is granted free trial lessons upon registration (typically 2 sessions). You can book 1-to-1 private video lessons with any published faculty member. Once your trial quota is exhausted, you will be directed to our course catalog to enroll in a structured diploma course.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is your lesson cancellation & rescheduling policy?",
    a: "You can cancel or reschedule any scheduled lesson up to 24 hours prior to the session start time without losing the lesson credit. Cancellations within 24 hours are non-refundable to respect the faculty member's reserved studio time.",
  },
  {
    q: "How are teachers assigned when I buy a course?",
    a: "When you enroll in a course, our academy administration reviews your schedule preferences and skill goals to assign the most suitable mentor from our vetted faculty. All subsequent lessons for that course are scheduled with your assigned teacher.",
  },
  {
    q: "When and how are graduation certificates issued?",
    a: "When you consume the final masterclass session of an enrolled course, our system automatically compiles and signs an official, verifiable Gandharva School of Music diploma PDF with your unique credential ID. It is permanently accessible under the 'My Certificates' tab.",
